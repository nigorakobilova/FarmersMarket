# FarmersMarket

Collaborated in a team of three to build a web app that helps people search for nearest farmerâ€™s markets based on their 
  inputted zip code or current location. Also allows viewing of driving directions to the selected market. 
  Once hovered over a certain location of the market, additional info is provided in a separate box.
Technologies used: Python, Django, Google Maps API, HTML5&CSS3, AJAX, jQuery, etc.
